\title{Empirical Quantile Mapping method for bias correction}
\usage{
eqm(o, p, s, precip, pr.threshold, n.quantiles, extrapolation)
}
\arguments{
\item{o}{A vector (e.g. station data) containing the observed climate data for the training period}

\item{p}{A vector containing the simulated climate by the model for the training period.}

\item{s}{A vector containing the simulated climate for the variable used in \code{p}, but considering the test period.}

\item{precip}{Logical for precipitation data. If TRUE Adjusts precipitation 
frequency in 'x' (prediction) to the observed frequency in 'y'. This is a preprocess to bias correct 
precipitation data following Theme√ül et al. (2012). To adjust the frequency, 
parameter \code{pr.threshold} is used (see below).}

\item{pr.threshold}{The minimum value that is considered as a non-zero precipitation. Ignored when 
\code{precip = FALSE}. See details in function \code{biasCorrection}.}

\item{n.quantiles}{Integer indicating the number of quantiles to be considered when method = "eqm". Default is NULL, 
that considers all quantiles, i.e. \code{n.quantiles = length(p)}.}

\item{extrapolation}{Character indicating the extrapolation method to be applied to correct values in
\code{"s"} that are out of the range of \code{"p"}. Extrapolation is applied only to the \code{"eqm"} method, 
thus, this argument is ignored if other bias correction method is selected.}
