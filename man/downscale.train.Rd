\usage{
downscale.train(obj, method, condition = NULL, threshold = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{An object. The object as returned by \code{\link[downscaleR]{prepareData}}.}

\item{method}{A string value. Type of transer function. Options are c("analogs","GLM","NN").}

\item{condition}{Inequality operator to be applied considering the given threshold. We only train with the days that satisfy the condition.
\code{"GT"} = greater than the value of \code{threshold}, \code{"GE"} = greater or equal,
\code{"LT"} = lower than, \code{"LE"} = lower or equal than.}

\item{threshold}{An integer. Threshold used as reference for the condition. Default is NULL. If a threshold value is supplied with no specificaction of the parameter 'condition'. Then condition is set to "GE".}

\item{...}{Optional parameters. These parameters are different depending on the method selected. Every parameter has a default value set in the atomic functions in case that no selection is wanted. 
Everything concerning these parameters is explained in the section \code{Details}. 
However, if wanted, the atomic functions can be seen here: \code{\link[downscaleR]{glm.train}} and \code{\link[deepnet]{nn.train}}.}
}
\value{
A list of objects that contains the prediction on the train dataset and the model.
\itemize{
   \item \code{pred}: An object with the same structure as the predictands input parameter, but with pred$Data being the predictions and not the observations.
   \item \code{model}: A list with the information of the model: method, coefficients, fitting ...
   }
}
\description{
Downscale data to local scales by statistical methods: analogs, generalized linear models (GLM) and Neural Networks (NN).
}
\details{
The function can downscale in both global and local mode, though not simultaneously. 
If there is perfect collinearity among predictors, then the matrix will not be invertible and the downscaling will fail.
We recommend to get rid of the NaN/NA values before calling the function.

\strong{Analogs}
The optional parameters of this method are:
\itemize{
\item \code{n.analogs} An integer. Number of analogs. Default is 4.
\item \code{sel.fun} A string. Select a function to apply to the analogs selected for a given observation. Options are 
"mean", "wmean" (i.e., weighted mean), "max", "min", "median", "prcXX" 
(i.e., prc85 means the 85th percentile of the analogs values distribution). Default is "mean".
the function applied to the analogs values, (i.e., sel.fun = c("mean","max","min","median","prcXX"), with default "mean") 
and the temporal window, (i.e., window = 0).
\item \code{window} An integer. Window of days removed when selecting analogs. 
If window = 7, then 7 days after the observation date and the 7 days before the observation date are removed. Default is 0.
\item \code{n.random} An integer. Choose N random analogs among the closest n.analogs. Default is NULL.
}
More information can be found in \code{\link[downscaleR]{analogs.train}}

\strong{Generalized Linear Models (GLM)}
The optional parameters depends on the \code{fitting} optional parameter:
\itemize{
\item \code{fitting} A string indicating the types of objective functions and how to fit the linear model.
\itemize{
\item \code{fitting = NULL} In this case the generalized linear model uses the \code{\link[stats]{glm}} function to fit the linear model. 
This is the default option.
The optional parameters when fitting = NULL are:
\itemize{
\item \code{family} A string indicating a description of the error distribution. Options are 
family = c("gaussian","binomial","Gamma","inverse.gaussian","poisson","quasi","quasibinomial","quasipoisson"). 
The links can be also specified and can be found in \code{\link[stats]{family}}.
\item \code{na.action} A function which indicates what should happen when the data contain NAs. 
The default is set by the na.action setting of options, and is na.fail if that is unset. 
The ‘factory-fresh’ default is na.omit. Another possible value is NULL, no action. Value na.exclude can be useful.
}
\item \code{fitting = "stepwise"} Indicates a stepwise regression via \code{\link[stats]{glm}} and \code{\link[stats]{step}}.
The optional parameters are the same than for fitting = NULL. The stepwise performs always a forward selection search stopping
\item \code{fitting = c("L1","L2","L1L2","gLASSO")}. These four options refer to ridge regression (L1 penalty), lasso regression (L2 penalty),
elastic-net regression (L1L2 penalty) and group Lasso regression (group L2 penalty). The model is fitted via 
\code{\link[glmnet]{glmnet}} and the corresponding penalties are found via \code{\link[glmnet]{cv.glmnet}}. This function \code{\link[glmnet]{glmnet}}
forces by default to standardize predictors, however we have changed it to standardize = FALSE, and standardization should be done prior to 
the downscaling process. 
The optional parameters when fitting = c("L1","L2","L1L2","gLASSO") are:
\itemize{
\item \code{family} A string indicating a description of the error distribution. Options are 
family = c("gaussian","binomial","Gamma","inverse.gaussian","poisson","quasi","quasibinomial","quasipoisson"). 
The links CAN NOT be specified as the \code{\link[glmnet]{glmnet}} has not been programmed to handle links.
However, the default ones can be found in \code{\link[stats]{family}}. If fitting = "gLASSO" then family must be "mgaussian".
\item \code{offset} A vector of length nobs that is included in the linear predictor (a nobs x nc matrix for the "multinomial" family). 
Useful for the "poisson" family (e.g. log of exposure time), or for refining a model by starting at a current fit. 
Default is NULL. If supplied, then values must also be supplied to the predict function.
}
}
There are two things to consider. 
1) If family = "binomial" then type = "response" when predicting values.
2) Except for fitting = "MP", for the rest of the fitting options, the parameter site must be TRUE, unless 
we want a gLASSO, in this case site must be FALSE.

}

\strong{Neural Networks}
Neural network is based on the library \pkg{deepnet}. The optional parameters corresponds to those in \code{\link[deepnet]{nn.train}}
and are: \code{initW} = NULL, \code{initB} = NULL, \code{hidden} = c(10), \code{activationfun} = "sigm", \code{learningrate} = 0.8, \code{momentum} = 0.5, 
\code{learningrate_scale} = 1, \code{output} = "sigm", \code{numepochs} = 3, \code{batchsize} = 100, \code{hidden_dropout} = 0, \code{visible_dropout} = 0. The values indicated are the default values.

\strong{Help}

If there are still doubts about the optional parameters despite the description here, we encourage to look for further details in the atomic functions: 
\code{\link[downscaleR]{analogs.train}}, \code{\link[downscaleR]{glm.train}} and \code{\link[deepnet]{nn.train}}.
