\title{Detrended quantile matching}
\usage{
dqm(o, p, s, precip, pr.threshold, n.quantiles, detrend = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{o}{A vector (e.g. station data) containing the observed climate data for the training period}

\item{p}{A vector containing the simulated climate by the model for the training period.}

\item{s}{A vector containing the simulated climate for the variable used in \code{p}, but considering the test period.}

\item{precip}{Logical indicating if o, p, s is precipitation data.}

\item{pr.threshold}{Integer. The minimum value that is considered as a non-zero precipitation.}

\item{n.quantiles}{Integer. Maximum number of quantiles to estimate. Default: same as data length.}

\item{detrend}{logical. Detrend data prior to bias correction? Default. TRUE.}
