\title{Generalized Quantile Mapping method for bias correction}
\usage{
gpqm(o, p, s, precip, pr.threshold, theta)
}
\arguments{
\item{o}{A vector (e.g. station data) containing the observed climate data for the training period}

\item{p}{A vector containing the simulated climate by the model for the training period.}

\item{s}{A vector containing the simulated climate for the variable used in \code{p}, but considering the test period.}

\item{precip}{Logical for precipitation data. If TRUE Adjusts precipitation 
frequency in 'x' (prediction) to the observed frequency in 'y'. This is a preprocess to bias correct 
precipitation data following Theme√ül et al. (2012). To adjust the frequency, 
parameter \code{pr.threshold} is used (see below).}

\item{pr.threshold}{The minimum value that is considered as a non-zero precipitation. Ignored when 
\code{precip = FALSE}. See details in function \code{biasCorrection}.}

\item{theta}{numeric indicating  upper threshold (and lower for the left tail of the distributions, if needed) 
above which precipitation (temperature) values are fitted to a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). 
Values below this threshold are fitted to a gamma (normal) distribution. By default, 'theta' is the 95th 
percentile (5th percentile for the left tail).}
